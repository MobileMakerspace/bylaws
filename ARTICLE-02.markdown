##Purpose##

1\. Purpose. The Corporation is organized exclusively for charitable,
scientific and educational purposes within the meaning of Section
501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, 1986, or the corresponding
provision of any future federal law. Such purposes include but are not
limited to:

\(a) Provide a place for members, students, and visitors to collaborate
on innovative ideas. We seek out creative individuals who have
innovative ideas and have a desire to make them a reality, but may not
have the time, skills, or resources to do so. These ideas can be based
on improvements to existing products, services, or processes. These
ideas may also be completely unique.

\(b) Provide training workshops, tools, facilities, resources, and
materials designed to turn innovative ideas into reality. Our objective
is to share our ideas with each other and pool all of our skills,
knowledge, and resources so that together, we can make these ideas
become a tangible product, service, or process.

\(c) Provide opportunities to present our projects to the public.
Projects and ideas may be selected for display at existing public
events, or at events that are created and sponsored by the group or
shared with other Maker groups.

\(d) Raise awareness of the global Maker movement and encourage others
contribute and participate.
